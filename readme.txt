Display your BPT events on your site using Brown Paper Tickets API for Fair Trade Ticketing.

== Description ==

This plugin pulls your events from BrownPaperTickets.com and will list all of them via a simple shortcode and the event date and time and provide a link for your users to buy tickets off of BPT. You can also display single events with the shortcode as well.

The display formating is basic but everything has classes for you to easily customize to fit your site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-bpt` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Brown Paper Tickets plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. You MUST add your BPT credentials to the Plugin Settings page for the plugin to work

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this an official plugin? =

Nope... we're not affiliated with BPT. Read Other Notes for more details.  

= What about payment stuff? =

We didn't include it into this version as we just built it quickly but that functionality can definitely be an option in the next version or so if enough people want it.
